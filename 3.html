    <h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="JavaScript Specification">
  JavaScript</a> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a
  programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9]
   JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-
   paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
    object-orientation, and first-class functions.

    <p>
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve
content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
specification of presentation

    <p style="margin-top:45px;">
    characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
    specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces
    complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as
    enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
    between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
